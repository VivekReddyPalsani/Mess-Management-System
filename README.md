# College Mess Management System

## Project Description
The College Mess Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the management of college mess activities. It features role-specific dashboards for students, chefs, managers, and college management, with functionalities such as menu planning, feedback collection, inventory management, and report generation. The project integrates with a MySQL database and uses JDBC for database connectivity.

## Required Software, Libraries, and Versions
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher
2. **MySQL**: Version 8.0 or higher
3. **MySQL JDBC Driver**: `mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar`
4. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE)
5. **Additional Libraries**:
    - Standard Java libraries (`java.sql`, `java.io`)
    - JDBC for MySQL database integration

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Software Installation
1. Install JDK 17 or higher and set up the environment variables (`JAVA_HOME`).
2. Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
3. Download the MySQL JDBC Driver (`mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar`) and add it to the classpath in IntelliJ IDEA.

---

### 2. Database Setup
1. Create a new MySQL database named `messmangement`.
2. Run the provided SQL scripts to create the required tables:
   - `users`
   - `feedback`
   - `menu`
   - `inventory`
   - `staff`
   - `dishes`
   - `counters`
   - `messpopulation`
3. Populate the tables with initial data using the provided SQL insert statements.

### 3. Steps to Run the Project

#### Compile the project:
```bash
javac temmain.java
```

#### Run the project:
1. In IntelliJ:
   - Right-click the **Main** class and select **Run**.
2. Or use the terminal:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Project Execution
- Ensure that the database username, password, and URL match your MySQL configuration.
- If you encounter any issues, check the IntelliJ logs for troubleshooting.
- The project supports role-based logins (`students`, `chefs`, `managers`, `college management`). Use the pre-populated database users or add your own entries for testing.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the database username, password, and URL match your MySQL configuration.
- If you encounter any issues, check the IntelliJ logs for troubleshooting.
- The project supports role-based logins (`students`, `chefs`, `managers`, `college management`). Use the pre-populated database users or add your own entries for testing.
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Proper Code Blocks**: Code snippets (`javac temmain.java`, `java Main`) are now enclosed in Markdown code blocks for better readability.
2. **Subheadings**: Headings like "Compile the project" and "Run the project" are properly separated and formatted for clarity.
3. **Avoided Repetition**: Removed redundant text in "Additional Notes."
